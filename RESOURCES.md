# Resources: Julia programming language

DISCLAIMER - these lists are far from complete; Feel free to add more items.

Here we collect resources for learning the Julia programming language.
Most general informations about the Julia language can be found in the
[project website](https://julialang.org). Associated with that is also the 
[discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org), where you may ask questions,
find announcements and a lot more. The [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) 
of the Julia programming language is also a good source for syntax and concepts, 
but it's more for searching specific things rather that a resource to learn the 
language. However, since most of the standard library of Julia is written in 
Julia itself, it is a very good resource for best practices related to different 
concepts.
