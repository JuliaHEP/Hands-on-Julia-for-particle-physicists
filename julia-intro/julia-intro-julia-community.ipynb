    "\n",
    "Whilst the **Julia** community is smaller than that for Python and C++, it's certainly well supported and active - and cross-fertilisation of ideas with other \"newer\" language communities such as *Rust* has led to a number of exciting developments as well."

    "\n",
    "Julia, like a lot of modern languages, has a relatively fast development tempo; sometimes too fast for distro package managers to sensibly keep up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way (IMO!) to manage a Julia install is with [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) - a Julia toolkit installation manager inspired by the excellent *Rustup* for the Rust programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Juliaup is available from the Windows App Store if you're developing with a Microsoft system, or via direct installation script for MacOS and Linux distributions (see the link)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can simply type in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "juliaup list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to show all the versions of Julia available.\n",
    "We will work with the newest version on all platforms, 1.9.2 so simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "juliaup install 1.9.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to set that up. \n",
