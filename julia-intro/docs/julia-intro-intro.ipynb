    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Julia** is a relatively young (2012) programming language designed to be effective for scientific workflows - the developers specifically call out Fortran and MATLAB as predecessors in this area. \n",
    "Compared to these, Julia has much of the dynamic and interactive expressiveness of languages such as *Python* (including functionality that is only provided there by the third-party *NumPy* library), whilst leveraging just-in-time compilation and specialisation to allow performance approaching (and sometimes better than) high-performance compiled languages such as *C*, *Modern Fortran* and *Rust*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of Julia properties\n",
    "\n",
    "+ High-performance (within 0.5 order of magnitude of C; often at parity)\n",
    "+ Fully Unicode supporting - including LaTeX markup support in REPL, and natural mathematical symbols for common operations\n",
    "+ First-class support in Jupyter (it's the *Ju* bit of the name)\n",
    "+ Supports object-oriented programming (with *multiple dispatch*), Functional-style method chaining, and other modern paradigms\n",
    "+ Dynamic typing, with efficient function specialisation (via JIT) and optional typing supported deeply in language (unlike Python)\n",

    "A Quick Overview of Julia Syntax\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of Julia's syntax should be easy to pick up for users of Python or other modern languages. The example functions above demonstrate much of the control flow, but we'll go over the basics quickly, pointing out Juliaisms where we see them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments in Julia are made with a **#**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types \n",
    "\n",
    "Values in Julia can have various *Types*, depending on the kind of data they represent. In common with many 21st C languages, Julia expresses the relationship between Types as a *Type Hierarchy*, as seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Julia Type Hierarchy, thanks to Uwe Hernandez Acosta](./images/numeric_types.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the leaves of the hierarchy are \"concrete types\" - types that a value can possess. The remaining types are \"abstract types\", existing to allow Julia to reason about common properties of two values of different types. \n",
    "\n",
    "A value of a particular concrete type also matches all of the abstract types above it in the hierarchy - a **Float64** value is also an **AbstractFloat**, a **Real** and a **Number**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, the \"<:\" operator expresses the relation of \"subtype\" - so it is **true** that **Float64 <: AbstractFloat**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, as in Python, you can write a value and assume that Julia will pick the correct type for it automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Declaration and Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Julia can be declared typelessly, like in Python - they must be declared with an assignment. In this case, they work like Python variables, taking on the type of whatever value is contained in them. Assigning a differently typed value to the variable changes its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables may use almost Unicode characters they like.\n",
    "\n",
    "(from now on, we'll be using the **@show** macro, which outputs the current line, and its result, as part of the Cell output, in order to cut down on the number of cells we need)"

    "(If Julia cannot convert a value without losing precision, it will instead throw an error)\n",
