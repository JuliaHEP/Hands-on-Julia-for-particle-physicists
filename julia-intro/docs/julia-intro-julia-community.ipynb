    "\n",
    "Whilst the **Julia** community is smaller than that for Python and C++, it's certainly well supported and active - and cross-fertilisation of ideas with other \"newer\" language communities such as *Rust* has led to a number of exciting developments as well."

    "### Managing Julia Packages (Pkg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia integrates its own package manager with a module called `Pkg`.\n",
    "From within a Julia shell, it is easy to install packages with\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"name-of-package\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "as long as they're known to the Julia ecosystem. \n",
    "Pkg will handle dependancies for any packages you install, and will usually precompile all of them to guarantee high performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pkg also exposes many other verbs - `build` (to precompile and re-setup packages), `update` (to fetch package updates), `rm` (to remove an installed package).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Packages are registered in the Julia [General Registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), and can be browsed with tools like [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com/) )\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably best to think of Pkg as similar to Cargo for Rust: it doesn't just manage packages for your general Julia installation, it also manages the environment for a Julia project.\n",
    "Any package will have a \"Project.toml\" file, which is managed by Pkg, which represents the dependencies and metadata for the project. You will see that this repository has such a file, showing the packages we need to import for one of the examples.\n",

    "### IJulia\n",
    "\n",
    "As Julia is one of the core Jupyter languages, it is easy to set up a Jupyter environment once you have a Julia install, with the IJulia package.\n",
    "With the help of the Pkg module, we can simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n",
    "using IJulia\n",

    "If you want to launch a notebook from within Julia itself, you can then simply type \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "notebook()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to launch your Jupyter notebook service.\n",
    "IJulia will prompt you to install and set up a local MiniConda instance for Jupyter if you want to be truly standalone, otherwise you can integrate with your existing Jupyter install."
