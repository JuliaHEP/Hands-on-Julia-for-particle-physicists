# An Introduction to Julia

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks quickly covering various syntactical aspects of Julia, with some nice pictures as a result.

The set of notebooks can also be processed by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) into a set of web pages.

- The `environment.yaml` file can be used by conda/mamba to setup the appropriate set of Python packages to do this.
