    "Why Julia?\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Julia** is a relatively young (2012) programming language designed to be effective for scientific workflows - the developers specifically call out Fortran and MATLAB as predecessors in this area. \n",
    "Compared to these, Julia has much of the dynamic and interactive expressiveness of languages such as *Python* (including functionality that is only provided there by the third-party *NumPy* library), whilst leveraging just-in-time compilation and specialisation to allow performance approaching (and sometimes better than) high-performance compiled languages such as *C*, *Modern Fortran* and *Rust*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of Julia properties\n",
    "\n",
    "+ High-performance (within 0.5 order of magnitude of C; often at parity)\n",
    "+ Fully Unicode supporting - including LaTeX markup support in REPL, and natural mathematical symbols for common operations\n",
    "+ First-class support in Jupyter (it's the *Ju* bit of the name)\n",
    "+ Supports object-oriented programming (with *multiple dispatch*), Functional-style method chaining, and other modern paradigms\n",
    "+ Dynamic typing, with efficient function specialisation (via JIT) and optional typing supported deeply in language (unlike Python)\n",
